This repository contains all my coding solutions and projects from the **Programming Fundamentals & Unit Testing** course, part of the **QA Engineer track at Software University (SoftUni)**.

The course focuses on building a strong programming foundation in C# and applying **unit testing** practices to ensure software correctness and reliability.

---

## What I'm Learning

- Variables, data types, and expressions
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Arrays and lists
- Methods and modular code
- Fundamentals of **unit testing** with NUnit
- Test-driven development concepts
- Real-world coding exercises and homework

## Each solution contains projects focused on a specific topic.

//This repository is part of my journey to become a **QA Engineer**, and is intended to:

- Practice writing clean and testable C# code
- Apply theoretical knowledge in practical exercises
- Track my learning progress in a structured way
- Demonstrate core programming and testing skills
